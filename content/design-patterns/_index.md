This final topic explores common patterns for system development across various facets:

**[1. Event-Driven Architecture]({{< ref "event-driven-architecture" >}})**:

- Understand the fundamentals of **Event-Driven Architecture**.
- Explore **Event Sourcing** and **Command-Query Segregation** patterns for effectively constructing event-driven systems.

**[2. Distributed Transactions]({{< ref "distributed-transaction" >}})**:

- Learn about low-level **blocking protocols** for executing distributed transactions.
- Discover **compensation protocols** for executing distributed transactions asynchronously.

**[3. Caching Patterns]({{< ref "caching-patterns" >}})**:

- Examine caching patterns and techniques to implement high-performance systems.

**[4. Distributed Job Patterns]({{< ref "distributed-job-patterns" >}})**:

- Discuss fundamental models (**Streaming**, **Batching**, **Kappa**) for creating cost-effective job systems.
- Learn to model an asynchronous job system using **Directed Acyclic Graph**.
