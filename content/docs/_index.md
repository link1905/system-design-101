Have you ever wondered how massive applications are built? Chances are, they don’t rely on a single service or database to handle enormous scale. Instead, a complex ecosystem of systems and "behind-the-scenes magic" works together seamlessly.

In this document, we explore the fundamental building blocks of {{< term sd >}}. I assume you’re starting with a clean slate in this field, so I’ll guide you step-by-step—from foundational concepts to more advanced topics:

**1. [Web Service](web-service/)**  
   Discover the {{< term ms >}} architecture and best practices for building scalable web services.

**2. [Data Persistence](data-persistence/)**  
   Learn about the persistence layer, the structure of common data stores, and the challenges of managing distributed storage.

**3. [System Administration](system-administration/)**  
   Explore core administrative tasks, essential components, and best practices for maintaining and deploying distributed systems.

**4. [Design Patterns](design-patterns/)**  
   Gain insights into architectural patterns crucial for designing large-scale systems.

Each topic is interconnected but designed to be self-contained, so you can read them independently. If you’re new to {{< term sd >}}, I recommend starting at the beginning and progressing gradually through the content.

## Key Considerations

Before diving in, keep these crucial points in mind.
They are the pillars we always aim for in the topics.

**1. Context matters.**  
   `System Design` depend heavily on the specific problem at hand. A solution that works well in one scenario might not be suitable in another. The goal is to identify the **most appropriate** approach for your system’s requirements.

**2. Simplicity is key.**  
   Complex designs are costlier to develop and maintain. Strive for an **effective yet simple** design, avoiding unnecessary sophistication.

**3. System design is an evolving process.**  
   Build systems based on **current requirements**, not hypothetical future needs. As the business evolves, so should the system architecture.
