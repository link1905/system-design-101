A **Web Service** acts as the representational layer that stands in front of the internally complex backend components.

In this introduction,
we'll cover the essential concepts needed to build a robust web service:

**[1. {{< term ms >}}]({{< ref "microservice" >}})**:
   - Explore the {{< term ms >}} architecture, its advantages, and how it differs from {{< term mono >}} systems.
   - Learn about the challenges of service coupling and how {{< term msg >}} can help decouple large-scale systems.

**[2. Service Cluster]({{< ref "service-cluster" >}})**:
   - Understand best practices for managing clusters of services, including critical concepts like {{< term health >}}
   and {{< term ha >}} (high availability).
   - Explore the two main types of service clusters: {{< term sl >}} and {{< term sf >}}.

**[3. Communication Protocols]({{< ref "communication-protocols" >}})**:
   - Get an overview of key protocols such as {{< term http >}}, {{< term ws >}}, and {{< term sse >}}.
   See how these protocols facilitate efficient client-server communication,
   as well as streaming protocols like {{< term webrtc >}} and {{< term hls >}}.

**[4. Load Balancer]({{< ref "load-balancer" >}})**:
   - Discover how load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and reliability.
   - Learn about various load balancing algorithms, the role of {{< term apigw >}}, and the differences between common types of load balancers: {{< term lb4 >}} and {{< term lb7 >}}.

**[5. API Design]({{< ref "api-design" >}})**:
   - Develop an understanding of **RESTful API** principles, including statelessness, uniform interfaces, and self-descriptive messages.
   - Learn about implementing API pagination for efficient data retrieval.

These foundational topics will equip you with the knowledge to design and implement effective web services.
